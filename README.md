# PowerBISalesReport
Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data sourced from Microsoft free samples for Power BI. This is my first project involving PowerBI and will help me become familiar with Power BI's interface, data importing, modeling, and basic visualisations.

I will be using the AdventureWorks Sales data.  
I carefully followed this tutorial from microsoft: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-dimensional-model-report

Here are some of my key learnings:  
- Data Importing: I learned about how to import data into Power BI, specifically using Excel as a data source.
- Data Transformation: I learned how to transform and prepare data using Power Query in Power BI. This included checking and setting data types for columns.
- Data Modeling: I understood the importance of data modeling in Power BI, including creating relationships between tables to create a star schema.
- Hierarchies: I learned how to create hierarchies in the data model to enable easier navigation and grouping of data.
- DAX Measures: I explored writing measures in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform calculations that enhance reporting capabilities.
- Report Building: I gained hands-on experience in creating different types of visuals in Power BI, including area charts, maps, and matrices, to answer specific business questions.
- Report Formatting: I learned how to format your report to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly, including adding titles, adjusting text sizes, and using themes.
- Slicers: I understood the use of slicers for interactive filtering of data in the report.
- Data Analysis: I gained insights into analyzing data to answer specific business questions, such as identifying the best-selling products and regions.
- Data Visualization: I learned how to effectively visualize data to communicate insights to stakeholders.
- Continuous Learning: I was encouraged to explore more about DAX, data modeling, and other advanced topics to further enhance my new Power BI skills.

This demonstrates my dedication to continuous learning and expanding my skill set, as I took the initiative to enhance my skills by independently learning Power BI. I followed a comprehensive tutorial provided by Microsoft to gain proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
